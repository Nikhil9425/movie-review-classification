# movie-review-classification

The Movie Review Data is a collection of movie reviews retrieved from the imdb.com website in the early 2000s by Bo Pang and Lillian Lee. The reviews were collected and made available as part of their research on natural language processing.

The reviews were originally released in 2002, but an updated and cleaned up version were released in 2004, referred to as “v2.0”.

The dataset is taken from kaggel and it contains 40k training samples labelled as 1 & 0 for positive and negative reviews.
